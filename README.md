# Spess
Spess is an experiment in gamemode creation for Garry's Mod, a Half Life 2/Source Engine mod. I'm seeking inspiration from Space Station 13 and Trouble in Terrorist Town (in buth concept and programming).

## Running
Clone or download and unzip this repository into your `...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\gamemodes\` directory, then just launch Garry's Mod and select Spess from the list of gamemodes in the bottom right corner.
